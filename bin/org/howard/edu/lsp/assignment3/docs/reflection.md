The difference between the two assignments' design is in the modulation of assignment 3. Although they perform the same tasks the classes in assignment three allow for the code to be reused in other areas and the classes can be modified and further improved to do the one task they're made for. Each piece can be tested on their own and if one breaks you know exactly where to go to fix it. 
Assignment 3 is more OO since all the code is no longer apart of one large script it's instead a collection of objects that all comes together to make the pipeline work. The product object can be reused in other classes and it will keep its same properties because of its existence as a class. 
The OO ideas that I made use of are objects (product), classes (each of the responsibilities so reading, writing, transforming), and encapsulation (CSVReader and Writer hide the actual reading and writing logic).
I used the same tests for assignment 3 and 2 to test that they both work the same.
