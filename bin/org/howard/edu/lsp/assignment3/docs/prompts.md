I used my previous chat from assignment two to start off this assignment. 
The prompt given was:
I want you to remake the ETL pipeline with a stronger focus on object oriented programming. Redesign your solution into multiple classes with clearer responsibilities. The requirements remain the same. Include Javadocs for each class and all public methods.

After providing intial code in response I gave it the requirements and rubric so that I could ensure that it had all the features necessary to complete the assignment.
